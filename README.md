# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis leverages visualizations and data profiling to extract meaningful insights from the historic Titanic disaster dataset.

# Overview

This project conducts EDA on the Titanic dataset to understand:

Passenger demographics and survival rates.

The relationship between features such as age, class, and sex, and survival probability.

Missing data and data preprocessing challenges.

The dataset contains details such as passenger class, age, sex, embarked port, and whether they survived.


# Features

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib.

Analysis of survival rates by age, gender, and class.

Data Profiling:

Comprehensive data profiling using pandas_profiling.

Data Preprocessing:

Identifying and handling missing values.

Summary statistics and distributions.
## Setup and Requirements

Prerequisites

To run the notebooks and scripts, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Required Python Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

pandas_profiling


## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
cd titanic-eda

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open EDA-checkpoint.ipynb to start the analysis.
## Usage

The repository includes the following key files:

EDA-checkpoint.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for Titanic dataset analysis.

titanic.csv: Dataset used for the analysis.

Follow the notebook steps to explore the dataset and visualize insights.

## Key Insights

Demographics and Survival:

Passengers in Class 3 had the highest mortality rate, while Class 1 had the highest survival rate.

Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

Age Distribution:

A wide range of ages is observed, with some age groups showing a higher survival rate.

Missing Data:

Several columns have missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin). Missing data handling is critical for analysis.
